## Chapter 4 - Building a Social Website

I have completed the following topics:

* Creating functionality for the user to log in, log out, reset the password
* Extending the user model with a custom profile model

Below is the list of my experiences -

* This is important to add ''account.apps.AccountConfig added to settings.py in the INSTALLED_APP list. I got an error, and took me some time to figure out that.
* Django provides powerful prebuilt views to handle login, logout, password change views (password reset). 
* I didn't set up an SMTP server, hence I couldn't follow all the steps for reset password using email.
* User registration page became easy due to Django provided views.
